The goal of the first stage of this project is to make a rust program that setups multiple clients to talk to different apis, get large datasets from the api, and store locally in distinct tables in a local sqlite3 database. Any time you present information ensure that it is factually correct and give a brief annotation of the source you derived it from. We want to compile all the data in a easily maintained since .db file.
